## About EngineRev
EngineRev allows you to keep track of your vehicle maintenance history and collaborate with the community. Keep your vehicle running smoothly and meet other passionate do-it-yourselfers in the forum. Ask questions and share vehicle diagnostic solutions with the community.

## Who is EngineRev For?
EngineRev is for anyone, mechanically inclined or not, who want to keep track of their vehicle service maintenance history. Users can create their own accounts and add vehicles they want to keep track of. They can also update their account information along with updating vehicle and service log information. Service logs are tracked by adding the date of service, the mileage of the vehicle, and the type of service performed on the vehicle. Have a car repair question or want to help someone else out? Head to the forums to see what others are talking about.

## A Little About the Creator
Not only do I work full-time as a Software Engineer, but I also have several years of experience in automotive repair (you donâ€™t see that combination every day). As an automotive mechanic, I need a program where I can easily pull it up on a computer or my phone to access my vehicle maintenance and repair history. This is where EngineRev comes in, which allows users to add vehicles and keep track of service logs while being able to share ideas through the forum. EngineRev is intended to be simple to use and to the point.
